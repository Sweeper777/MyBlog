This is me, Sweeper! My profile pic is an imaginary element. I made it back in the days when I still loved chemistry. Oh those good old days... 

Anyway, I answer [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) questions, but it's not like I have a *lot* of technical knowledge about programming or anything. I'm just good at looking things up (I think), and making educated guesses. And apparently, just by using those two skills, and a *little* bit of knowledge, I got to 100k reputation in 5 years time

Oftentimes (more like almost always), I don't know the answer to a question right away. I have to go through a few Google searches before I can write my answer. Sometimes I find a duplicate while doing that, in which case I vote to close it. Other times, the series of searches leads me to a wonderful journey, and I end up learning a lot (probably more than the original poster). Those are the situations that I will be recording in this blog.

Of course, I also write about other stuff here. It's *my* blog after all. :D

**TL;DR:** Sometimes I write really good answers to questions that I initially knew very little about, and I write about how I answer them here.
